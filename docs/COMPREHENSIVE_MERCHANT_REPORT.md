### Churn Reasons Analysis

**Primary Churn Drivers (Based on Exit Surveys & Analysis):**

| Reason | % of Churned | Business Impact | Prevention Cost |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Insufficient Volume** | 38% | Low LTV anyway | Low (selection) |
| **Operational Overwhelm** | 22% | High LTV lost | Medium (support) |

| **Competitor Switch** | 12% | Direct loss | High (retention) |
| **Business Closure** | 7% | Unavoidable | N/A |

- Single location
- Minimal marketing
- Low brand recognition

**Why They Churned:**
- Not enough orders to justify effort
- Platform fees exceed value
- "Better off without delivery"
- Never reached critical mass

**Prevention Strategy:**
- **Selection:** Don't onboard unlikely successes
- **Criteria:** Minimum brand presence, existing customer base
- **Trial Period:** 90-day evaluation, exit if <50 orders
- **Cost to Prevent:** Low (better screening)
- **Worth Preventing:** No (low LTV, high churn risk)

---

#### **2. Operational Overwhelm (22% of churn)**

**Profile:**
- Small/medium merchants
- Growing quickly (100%+ growth)
- Poor completion rates (<85%)
- Customer complaints

---

### Priority 6: Data-Driven Merchant Selection

**Problem:** 53% of merchants are dormant (<100 orders/year), generating only 1.6% of orders but consuming support resources.

**Recommendation: Selective Onboarding Framework**

**Objective:** Reduce dormant merchant % from 53% to <35% by improving selection criteria

**Framework:**

1. **Pre-Onboarding Assessment (Implement Month 1)**

   - Minimum customer base (evidence of traction)
   - Category fit (filling gap vs. saturated)
   - Geographic priority (growth areas weighted)
   - Operational readiness (capacity, staff, systems)

   **Scoring System (0-100):**
   - **Brand Presence (20 points)**
     - Website: 5 pts
     - Active social media: 5 pts
     - Google/review presence: 5 pts
     - Existing customers: 5 pts

   - **Market Opportunity (25 points)**
     - Category gap: 10 pts
     - Geographic need: 10 pts
     - Competitive advantage: 5 pts

   - **60-74:** Conditional approval (support needed)
   - **45-59:** Review by manager
   - **<45:** Decline

2. **Trial Period (90 Days)**
   - All new merchants on 90-day evaluation
   - Minimum threshold: 50 orders in 90 days
   - Below threshold: Exit counseling
   - Above threshold: Full onboarding

3. **Category & Geographic Quotas**
   - Limit new merchants in saturated categories/areas
   - Prioritize strategic gaps
   - Example: "No new coffee shops in Salmiya" for 6 months

4. **Active Dormancy Management**
   - Quarterly review of merchants <25 orders/quarter
   - Outreach: Reactivation campaign
   - If no response: Account suspension
   - Cleanup: Remove inactive accounts (improves marketplace quality)

**Investment:** $150K (assessment tools, team training)

**Expected Outcomes:**
- **Selection Improvement:** 58% first-year churn → 35-40%
- **Resource Efficiency:** Support focus on productive merchants
- **Quality Signal:** Marketplace appears higher-quality to customers
- **Reduced Churn:** Better-fit merchants stay longer

**ROI:**
- 200 fewer dormant additions = 100 support hours/month saved = $60K/year

---

## Conclusion

The merchant ecosystem represents both the platform's greatest strength and its most significant vulnerability. With 1,498 active merchants generating 3.5M orders over three years, the foundation is solid but requires strategic intervention to ensure sustainable growth.

**Critical Takeaways:**

1. **Extreme Concentration Risk:** Top 1.3% of merchants generate 37% of orders. Loss of 5-10 enterprise merchants would be devastating.

2. **Weak Middle Tier:** Only 12.5% of merchants in the critical medium tier (1K-10K orders). Strengthening this segment is key to diversification and growth.

3. **Churn Crisis:** 33.6% annual churn rate in 2025, up from 23.5% in 2024. Without intervention, will lose 40%+ of base annually.

4. **Quality Erosion:** Platform completion rate declining (91.75% → 90.94%). Target should be 93%+ for competitiveness.

5. **Geographic Opportunity:** Significant growth potential in suburban areas (Ahmadi, Farwaniya) with 15-25% annual growth rates.

6. **Selection Problem:** 53% of merchants dormant (<100 orders/year), indicating poor onboarding criteria.

**Path Forward:**

The six strategic priorities outlined represent a comprehensive approach to merchant ecosystem strengthening. With a $2.6M Year 1 investment, the platform can:
- Secure top merchant relationships
- Grow the critical middle tier
- Reduce churn by 25%+
- Expand into high-growth geographies
- Improve quality metrics
- Optimize merchant selection

**Success will require:**
- Executive commitment and resources
- Cross-functional coordination (ops, marketing, tech)
- Sustained focus over 18-24 months
- Willingness to make hard decisions (account suspensions, category limits)
- Data-driven decision making and continuous optimization

The alternative - maintaining current trajectory - will result in continued concentration risk, high churn, quality erosion, and eventual competitive vulnerability. The time to act is now.
