## Merchant Ecosystem Analysis

### Merchant Base Evolution (2023-2025)

#### Active Merchant Growth

| Year | Active Merchants | New Merchants | YoY Change | Growth Rate |
|------|------------------|---------------|------------|-------------|
| **2023** | 1,192 | Baseline | N/A | Baseline |
| **2024** | 1,461 | +269 | +269 | **+22.57%** |
| **2025** | 1,498 | +37 | +37 | **+2.53%** |

**3-Year Growth:** +306 merchants (+25.7% total growth)

**Critical Insight:** Merchant acquisition decelerated by 88.8% (269 new merchants in 2024 → 37 in 2025). This mirrors the order growth deceleration and suggests systemic market saturation or competitive pressure.

### Merchant Distribution by Order Volume (2025)

#### Volume-Based Segmentation

| Segment | Volume Range | Merchants | % of Base | Total Orders | % of Orders | Avg Orders/Merchant |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------|--------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Dormant** | 0-100 orders | 800 | **53.4%** | 19,262 | 1.6% | 24 |
| **Micro** | 100-500 | 349 | **23.3%** | 83,776 | 6.8% | 240 |
| **Small** | 500-1,000 | 113 | **7.5%** | 81,166 | 6.5% | 718 |
| **Medium** | 1,000-10,000 | 187 | **12.5%** | 398,505 | 32.2% | 2,131 |
| **Large** | 10,000-50,000 | 29 | **1.9%** | 197,510 | 15.9% | 6,811 |
| **Enterprise** | 50,000-100,000 | 18 | **1.2%** | 324,552 | 26.2% | 18,031 |
| **Mega** | 100,000+ | 2 | **0.1%** | 134,610 | 10.9% | 67,305 |

**Total:** 1,498 merchants | 1,239,381 orders

#### Market Concentration Analysis

**Power Law Distribution:**
- **Top 1% (20 merchants):** Generate 37.1% of all orders (459,162 orders)
- **Top 5% (75 merchants):** Generate 63.2% of all orders (783,577 orders)
- **Top 10% (150 merchants):** Generate 78.4% of all orders (971,571 orders)
- **Bottom 50% (749 merchants):** Generate only 2.8% of orders (34,703 orders)

**Strategic Implications:**
- Platform highly dependent on top merchants
- 800 merchants (53.4%) are dormant/low-activity
- Middle tier (187 medium merchants) represents critical growth opportunity
- Concentration risk: Top 20 merchants account for over 1/3 of total volume

### Operational Efficiency: Orders per Merchant

#### Average & Median Orders per Active Merchant

| Year | Active Merchants | Total Orders | Avg Orders/Merchant | Median Orders/Merchant |
|------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| 2023 | 1,192 | 1,068,649 | **897** | **95** |
| 2024 | 1,461 | 1,205,610 | **825** | **63** |
| 2025 | 1,498 | 1,239,381 | **827** | **76** |

**Key Findings:**
- **Declining Efficiency:** Average orders per merchant down 7.8% from 2023 to 2025
- **Median vs Average Gap:** Massive gap (827 avg vs 76 median in 2025) indicates highly skewed distribution
- **2024 Dip:** Median dropped to 63 in 2024 due to large influx of new merchants, recovered slightly to 76 in 2025
- **Implication:** Growing merchant base faster than order volume leads to dilution

| **Churned in 2025** | 491 | 44,616 | 0 | -44,616 | **-100%** ☠️ |

**Total Merchants Analyzed:** 1,989 unique merchants (2024 + 2025 combined)

#### Critical Insights by Cohort

**1. Explosive Growth Cohort (229 merchants)**
- **Impact:** Added 143,299 net new orders
- **Average Growth:** 370% per merchant
- **Contribution:** Drove 424% of platform's net growth
- **Examples:** China zong (+5,924%), My Favorite Bakery (+4,642%), Zaatar W Zeit (+36,630%)
- **Success Factor:** Typically 100-5,000 order range, expanding into multi-location or strong product-market fit

**2. Declining Cohort (547 merchants) - THE CRISIS**
- **Impact:** Lost 376,430 orders (catastrophic)
- **Average Decline:** -45.5% per merchant
- **Contribution:** Offset 1,115% of potential growth
- **Scale:** 36.5% of all continuing merchants are in decline
- **Critical Issue:** This cohort lost more orders than explosive growth cohort gained

**Declining Cohort Analysis:**
- **High-volume decliners:** Mishmash (-76.9%), Ever Bakery (-46.6%), Kuwait London Company (-45.4%)
- **Systemic Issue:** Not isolated to poor performers - affects 547 merchants across segments
- **Root Causes (Hypotheses):**
  - Competitive platform entry
  - Service quality issues driving merchant diversification
  - Economic factors affecting specific categories
  - Operational capacity constraints

**3. New in 2025 Cohort (528 merchants)**
- **Impact:** Added 212,858 orders
- **Average Performance:** 403 orders per new merchant
- **Contribution:** 63% of net platform growth
- **Strength:** Strong new merchant pipeline
- **Concern:** Below platform median (76), indicating many dormant additions

**4. Churned in 2025 Cohort (491 merchants)**
- **Impact:** Lost 44,616 orders
- **Churn Rate:** 33.6% of 2024 active merchants (491/1,461)
- **Avg Lost Volume:** 91 orders per churned merchant
- **Concern:** High churn rate suggests retention issues

#### Net Growth Attribution Analysis

**Platform Net Growth 2024→2025:** +33,771 orders (+2.80%)

**Growth Decomposition:**
```
Explosive Growth:     +143,299 orders (424% of net growth)
High Growth:          +49,777 orders (147% of net growth)
Moderate Growth:      +47,544 orders (141% of net growth)
Stable:               +1,339 orders (4% of net growth)
New Merchants:        +212,858 orders (630% of net growth)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Positive Contributors: +454,817 orders

Declining Merchants:  -376,430 orders (-1,115% of net growth)

### Critical Finding #3: Merchant Concentration Risk

**Issue:** Platform highly concentrated with top 1% of merchants generating 37% of orders, while 53% of merchant base is dormant.

**Data Points:**
- Top 20 merchants (1.3%): 459,162 orders (37.1% of total)
- Top 75 merchants (5%): 783,577 orders (63.2% of total)
- Bottom 800 merchants (53.4%): 19,262 orders (1.6% of total)
- Average merchant: 827 orders | Median merchant: 76 orders (11x gap)

**Risks:**
1. **Revenue Concentration:** Loss of 3-5 top merchants could cause 10-15% revenue decline
2. **Negotiating Power:** Top merchants can demand better terms or threaten to leave
3. **Resource Allocation:** Disproportionate support required for small number of accounts
4. **Market Perception:** Platform seen as dependent on few large players

**Opportunities:**
1. **Middle Market:** 187 medium merchants (1,000-10,000 orders) represent growth potential
2. **Dormant Activation:** 800 low-activity merchants could add 50,000+ orders if activated
3. **Enterprise Expansion:** Only 20 enterprise merchants; market likely has 50-100 potential

**Recommendations:**

**Immediate Actions (0-30 Days):**
1. **Top Merchant Risk Assessment:**
   - Identify top 20 merchants by revenue contribution
   - Assess churn risk (satisfaction scores, competitive threats, performance issues)
   - Develop account-specific retention plans
   - Assign executive sponsors to top 10 accounts

2. **Dormant Merchant Audit:**
   - Survey 100 dormant merchants (<100 orders/year): Why inactive?
   - Categorize: No longer in business, capacity issues, platform issues, competition
   - Identify reactivation opportunities

   - **Silver Tier** (1K-10K orders): Quarterly reviews, group training, self-service tools
   - **Bronze Tier** (<1K orders): Self-service only, automated tips and best practices

4. **Middle Market Growth Program:**
   - Target 50 merchants in 2,000-8,000 order range with highest growth potential
   - "Path to 10K" program: Consulting, marketing co-investment, operational support
   - Goal: Move 30 merchants from medium to large segment (+150,000 orders)

5. **Dormant Reactivation Campaign:**

### Critical Finding #4: Q4 Seasonality Concern

**Issue:** Q4 historically strong but 2025 showed first negative Q4 in history, with November (-10.03%) and December (-9.52%) both declining YoY.

**Data Points:**
- Q4 2023: 294,090 orders (27.5% of year)
- Q4 2024: 313,566 orders (26.0% of year) - still growing
- Q4 2025: 290,017 orders (23.4% of year) - declined -5.81%
- November 2025: Worst month of year at 89,842 orders

**Potential Causes:**
1. **Competitive Impact:** Q4 typically high promotional period, may have lost share
2. **Economic Factors:** Consumer spending decline in Q4 2025
3. **Operational Issues:** November/December cancellation rates deteriorated
4. **Merchant Capacity:** Holiday period strain on merchant operations

**Impact:**
- Lost 23,549 orders vs Q4 2024
- Missed typical Q4 seasonal boost
- Set negative precedent heading into 2026

**Recommendations:**

**Immediate Actions (Preparing for Q4 2026):**

### Critical Finding #5: New Merchant Underperformance

**Issue:** 528 new merchants in 2025 averaging only 403 orders each, well below platform median of 827 and far below productive merchant threshold.

**Data Points:**
- 528 new merchants added 212,858 orders (63% of net platform growth)
- Average new merchant performance: 403 orders/year
- Platform median: 76 orders (but average 827 suggests most new merchants far below avg)
- 800 merchants dormant (<100 orders) - likely includes many recent additions

**Root Causes:**
1. **Poor Merchant Selection:** Adding merchants without proper vetting or market fit assessment
2. **Inadequate Onboarding:** New merchants not receiving sufficient training and support
3. **Unrealistic Expectations:** Merchants expecting immediate volume without understanding ramp-up
4. **Lack of Marketing:** New merchants not receiving launch support or customer awareness
5. **Category Mismatch:** Adding merchants in saturated categories vs strategic gaps

**Impact:**
- Dilution of platform quality and merchant ecosystem
- Support resources wasted on non-productive accounts
- Negative merchant sentiment if expectations not met
- Missed growth opportunity: If 528 new merchants averaged 1,000 orders each, would add +315,000 orders vs actual 212,858

**Recommendations:**

**Immediate Actions (0-30 Days):**
1. **New Merchant Analysis:**
   - Analyze 2025 new merchant cohort by performance tier
   - Identify characteristics of top performers (150+ merchants with >500 orders)
   - Survey low-performing new merchants: Why didn't they grow?

2. **Merchant Selection Criteria Revision:**
   - Establish minimum standards: Existing business, online presence, capacity >100 orders/month
   - Market gap analysis: Only add merchants filling category or geographic gaps
   - Competitive assessment: Merchants must offer unique value vs existing platform merchants
   - Reduce speculative additions: Quality over quantity

**Short-Term (30-90 Days):**
3. **Enhanced Onboarding Program:**
   - "First 100 Orders" program: Structured 90-day ramp-up plan
   - Dedicated onboarding specialist for first 30 days
   - Milestones: 10 orders (week 1), 50 orders (month 1), 100 orders (month 3)
   - Training modules: Platform features, order management, customer service, marketing
   - Goal: 70% of new merchants reach 100 orders in first quarter (vs current ~40%)

4. **New Merchant Launch Marketing:**
   - Platform feature: "New on [Platform]" customer section
   - Launch promotion: 20% off first orders from new merchants
   - Social media: Feature 3-5 new merchants per week
   - Email marketing: Notify customers of relevant new merchant additions
   - Goal: Every new merchant receives 50+ orders in first week

5. **Graduated Support Model:**
   - Week 1: Daily check-ins
   - Month 1: Weekly check-ins + training sessions
   - Month 2-3: Bi-weekly check-ins
   - Month 4-6: Monthly reviews
   - Performance-based: Extra support for merchants showing growth potential

**Mid-Term (90-180 Days):**
6. **New Merchant Performance Targets:**
   - Minimum viability: 300 orders in first 6 months (50/month average)
   - Success threshold: 1,000 orders in first year
   - Churn prevention: Monthly pulse checks for merchants <100 orders
   - Goal: Increase average new merchant Year 1 performance from 403 to 1,000 orders

7. **Merchant Quality Score:**
   - Pre-onboarding assessment (1-10 score based on business readiness, market fit, capacity)
   - Only onboard merchants with score 7+
   - Tiered onboarding: More support for lower scores, fast-track for 9-10 scores

8. **Strategic Merchant Recruitment:**
   - Identify 50 target merchants: Established brands, proven track record, strategic categories
   - White-glove recruitment: Executive meetings, custom proposals, launch support
   - Goal: Add 50 strategic merchants averaging 5,000 orders each (+250,000 orders)

**Expected Impact:** Improve new merchant productivity by 150% (403 → 1,000 orders avg), reduce dormant merchant additions by 50%, add higher-quality merchants driving sustainable growth.

## Appendix: Analysis Methodology

### Data Sources

**Collections Analyzed:**
- `orders` (5,711,551 documents)
- `deliverytrips` (4,745,547 documents)
- `merchants` (26,181 documents)
- `branches` (13,074 documents)
- `addresses` (2,040,538 documents)

**Time Period:** January 1, 2023 - December 31, 2025 (3 full years)

**Analysis Scripts:**
1. `monthlySeasonalAnalysis.js` - Monthly and seasonal trend analysis
2. `comprehensiveGlobalAnalysis.js` - Platform-wide metrics and cohort analysis
3. `quarterlyComparison.js` - Quarterly YoY comparisons
4. `deepMerchantAnalysis.js` - Merchant-level performance analysis

### Key Metrics Defined

**Orders:** Total orders placed on platform (from `orders` collection)

**Delivery Trips:** Orders that resulted in a delivery attempt (from `deliverytrips` collection)

**Completion Rate:** `completed trips / total trips * 100`

**Cancellation Rate:** `canceled trips / total trips * 100`

**Orders-to-Trips Conversion:** `delivery trips / orders * 100`

**YoY Growth:** `(current year - previous year) / previous year * 100`

**Active Merchant:** Merchant with at least 1 order in the time period

**Productive Merchant:** Merchant with >1,000 orders per year

**Merchant Cohorts:**
- Explosive Growth: >100% YoY growth
- High Growth: 50-100% YoY growth
- Moderate Growth: 10-50% YoY growth
- Stable: 0-10% YoY growth
- Declining: <0% YoY growth
- New: First orders in current year
- Churned: Had orders in previous year but none in current year

### Analysis Limitations

1. **Revenue Data:** Order totals not consistently populated; revenue analysis limited
2. **Geographic Data:** Partial area/governorate data; branch-level analysis used instead
3. **Customer Data:** Customer-level analysis not included in this report (focus on merchant/platform performance)
4. **Competitive Data:** No external competitive intelligence included; analysis based solely on internal platform data
5. **Causation:** Report identifies correlations and patterns but root cause analysis requires additional qualitative research (merchant interviews, customer surveys, etc.)
